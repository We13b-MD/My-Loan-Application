# My-Loan-Application
A simple loan application that shows and tells us the Loan EMI, Total interest payable and Total Amount
Using the EMI formula, the project displays the entire amount due as well as the interest that will be due in a few months. 
After the loan was issued for a specific amount of time, a graph was added to illustrate the total interest that would need to be repaid. 
Link to the project is displayed below:
